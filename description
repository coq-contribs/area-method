Description: This contribution is the implementation of the Chou, Gao and Zhang's area method decision procedure for affine plane geometry.
This development contains a formalization of the first two chapters of the book "Machine Proofs in Geometry, Automated Production of Readable Proofs for Geometry Theorems" by Chou, Gao and Zhang.
The examples shown automatically includes the Ceva, Desargues, Menelaus, Pascal, Centroïd, Pappus, Gauss line theorems.
